# WhatTheFruit
An ASCII game made during my ASCII-obsessive years (2012). This game is about creating a drawing system in the windows console and making it into a game. The best part is the free draw. One problem with this game is the mouse selection isn't calibrated properly. All files are here for anyone to mess around with and enjoy!
